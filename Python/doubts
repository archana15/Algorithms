- repr() and eval() operators -> differences 

- main()
    the main function written in file x cannot be imported by another file y ?
    
    (this code calls the main function to get everything started. The condition in this
    if statement evaluates to True when the module is executed by the interpreter, but
    not when it is imported into another module.) 

    (Sometimes we write modules that we may
    want to import into another module. Writing this if statement to call the main func-
    tion makes the module execute its own main function when it is run as a stand-alone
    program. When the module is imported into another module it will not execute its
    main function.)
